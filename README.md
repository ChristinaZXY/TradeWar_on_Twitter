# TradeWar_on_Twitter

Years of trade tensions between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies have taken a worse turn since the start of 2018. President Donald Trump's "trade war" officially began on March 1 when he announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were then signed into effect on March 8. The situation escalated since March 22, when U.S. Trade Representative proposed 25 percent duties on Chinese products and China quickly fought back by levying tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. imports. From April 03 onwards, the focus is at Intellectual property abd high-tech industrial products.

"Trade war" has become a focal topic on social media. Twitter, being one of the largest social media platform, has recorded hundreds of thousands of people's opinions on this issue. The figure below depicts the number of tweets generated each day concerning about the "trade war". The three jumps clearly match with the three critical dates on the timeline.
